# Current_Market_Price_Python_Script

<h2>Purpose:</h2>

This script scrapes prices from https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/future/sp%20500%20futures to get the current Market Price.
Created because I was annoyed with all the annoying news that pops up when you visit the site, I just wanted the price, and I could run it easily with just two keystrokes.

<h2>STEPS to use:</h2>
Just run it from your terminal or create a batch file and add the folder to your PATH so you can run it easily from the run command box.
